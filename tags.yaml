        usually shows up in legends as a young girl with Martin
        as her brother. Since she currently is a young girl and Martin is
        currently her brother, she doesn’t have to master the finer points of
        acting.

      desc: |
        usually shows up in legends as Jane’s slightly older
        brother. He thinks suffering is necessary for wisdom. He makes
        unsettling inventions. He’s more cynical than Jane, in part because
        he’s usually wearing cynicism goggles<!--(see Two Great Tastes for a
        guide to how to make these.)-->.

        hang out. And then they fight! It’s probably
        something that happened to them before they joined the cast at the
        Gibbelins’ Tower. Like, a basketball game gone bad, or Max locking Sid
        in a box or something.

      desc: |
        are stock players. If you see a name
        repeated a lot, it usually means that someone in the Gibbelins’ Tower
        crew is playing the relevant roles. It seems to take more effort for
        them to adopt new names for the sake of a performance, so the theater
        crew only does that when they have to.

      desc: |
        was one of the people of salt. To evade the monster, she died,
        revived herself, and hid in the tunnels. At some point, the
        monster found her. He renamed her Jane. Unhappy, she
        fled to the firewood world and tried to make her life
        there. It didn’t work, and sometime between then and now,
        Martin found her and remade her. He kept the name Jane.

      tag: Liril
      desc: |
        is one of the people of salt; that is, a child of the line
        that is the monster’s natural prey. The monster put the Thorn
        That Does Not Kill through her neck, stealing her volition,
        but circumstances have recently conspired to return a certain
        dynamism to her life. This is almost as much her story as it
        is Jane’s, except she doesn’t put on 250 shows a year
        explaining her perspective on things.

        wear jackets with holes cut out for their
        wings. Actually, pretty much every angel in this story wears a jacket,
        and almost everyone noted as wearing a jacket is an angel. Evasive A
        is uncatchable, Forbidden A is best not thought about, Magic A has a
        nonzero chance of accomplishing anything, and Realistic A can provide
        a realistic assessment of any situation.

        is probably that aspect of Tathagata Buddha who is a ninja. He
        might also be the scion of a clan of ninjas who adopt the
        names of classic Buddhas when they achieve Ninja Nirvana. It’s
        hard to say without infinite wisdom.

      desc: |
        is the world’s fundamental tendency to include hostility and
        anguish in everyday life. He fights a neverending battle with
        Ninja Tathagata.
      # eyes blazing
      # Dukkha localizes with a swirl of his cape.
      # He’s calm, Dukkha is. He’s cool. He’s terrifying. He makes the world seem to stop and he fills the air with cruel.
      # His feet go first, just like a coyote’s might. They stretch out his legs.
      # The last Ink sees of him for a very long time is his endlessly malevolent ears and the sign he holds up, “I hate you all.”
