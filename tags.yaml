        usually shows up in legends as a young girl with Martin
        as her brother. Since she currently is a young girl and Martin is
        currently her brother, she doesn’t have to master the finer points of
        acting.

        usually shows up in legends as Jane’s slightly older
        brother. He thinks suffering is necessary for wisdom. He makes
        unsettling inventions. He’s more cynical than Jane, in part because
        he’s usually wearing cynicism goggles<!--(see Two Great Tastes for a
        guide to how to make these.)-->.

        comes out when the performance isn’t ready and
        narrates stuff. Every theater needs a Mrs. Schiff! Her first name is
        Parvati.

        drives the sun across the sky. Not every legend
        with her in it is about this, but she does.

        hang out. And then they fight! It’s probably
        something that happened to them before they joined the cast at the
        Gibbelins’ Tower. Like, a basketball game gone bad, or Max locking Sid
        in a box or something.

        is a rat who lives at the Gibbelins’ Tower. He can
        play all kinds of animals so sometimes people think he’s actually a
        parrot or a gazebra.

        are stock players. If you see a name
        repeated a lot, it usually means that someone in the Gibbelins’ Tower
        crew is playing the relevant roles. It seems to take more effort for
        them to adopt new names for the sake of a performance, so the theater
        crew only does that when they have to.

        was one of the people of salt. To evade the monster, she died,
        revived herself, and hid in the tunnels. At some point, the
        monster found her. He renamed her Jane. Unhappy, she
        fled to the firewood world and tried to make her life
        there. It didn’t work, and sometime between then and now,
        Martin found her and remade her. He kept the name Jane.

        wear jackets with holes cut out for their
        wings. Actually, pretty much every angel in this story wears a jacket,
        and almost everyone noted as wearing a jacket is an angel. Evasive A
        is uncatchable, Forbidden A is best not thought about, Magic A has a
        nonzero chance of accomplishing anything, and Realistic A can provide
        a realistic assessment of any situation.
